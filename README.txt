# EgoGame
This is a little solitairesque cardgame I developed with python using the pygame module. The program works fine, i just haven't figured ot how to fix the clock.
Use the mouse button to draw new cards, use the arrow buttons to move your view and use the spacebar to move cards to the left.

Rules:
Cards are lined up form left to right. If two cards have either the same value or the same suit the card between them can be moved to the left. This is done until all cards are gone and it's impossible to move cards. The goal of the game is to have two piles left in the end, which is very unlikely :^)

Requirements:
Pygame and Python
